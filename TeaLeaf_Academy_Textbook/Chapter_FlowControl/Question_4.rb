1. '4' == 4 ? puts("TRUE") : puts("FALSE")
2. x = 2
   if ((x * 3) / 2) == (4 + 4 - x - 3)
     puts "Did you get it right?"
   else
     puts "Did you?"
   end
3. y = 9
   x = 10
   if (x + 1) <= (y)
     puts "Alright."
   elsif (x + 1) >= (y)
     puts "Alright now!"
   elsif (y + 1) == x
     puts "ALRIGHT NOW!"
   else

   end
   
###ANSWERS###
#1) Will print False cause string vrs intergers arent the same
#2) Will print Did you get ir right, cuase its true cuase 3 does equal 3
#3) 11 isnt <- 9 so first one is false, 11 is >= 9 so it will print Allright now! and end even though the next elsif statement is also correct
