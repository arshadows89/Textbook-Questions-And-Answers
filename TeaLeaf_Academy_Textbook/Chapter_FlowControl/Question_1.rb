#Write down whether the following expressions return true or false. Then type the expressions into irb to see the results.
#1. (32 * 4) >= 129
#2. false != !true
#3. true == 4
#4. false == (847 == '874')
#5. (!true || (!(100 / 5) == 20) || ((328 / 4) == 82)) || false

###ANSWERS###
#1) 128 >= 129 its not so its = false
#2) false is not false is not true so = false
#3) true does not ==  4 so its = false
#4) 847 is not '847' ones a interger other is a stringe. and becuase its false it is = true
#5) 328/4 =  82 next 82 == 82 is true 100 / 5 = 20 next !20 == 20 is false!true(false) or false = false next false or true = true next true or false, atleast one is true this everything = true
